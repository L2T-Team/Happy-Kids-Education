The tournament took place at La Reina High School and Middle School in Thousand Oaks, California, and featured a state qualifier for the VEX Robotics Competition. With **36 teams** participating, the competition was fierce, and the atmosphere was charged with excitement and innovation.

## Our Remarkable Journey
In the competitive arena of the La Reina High School regional robotics tournament, the spotlight was on team **91741A - Juicy Boba** from Happy Kids Education. Comprised of two remarkable students from **grades 6 and 7, William and Nicole**, their presence was a profound statement of youthful talent and potential.

Despite facing opponents from higher grade levels, our young champions approached each of the six qualification matches with a blend of enthusiasm and strategic acumen. Their journey was not just about competing; it was about defying expectations and breaking barriers.

With each round, they demonstrated that age is merely a number, and skill knows no bounds. Their hard work, coupled with the robust STEM curriculum provided by Happy Kids Education, became the cornerstone of their success. It was this unique blend of education and application that propelled them to outperform and outlast the competition, securing the top rank in all six matches.

This achievement is a testament to the nurturing environment at Happy Kids Education, where we believe in empowering our students to reach for the stars, no matter how young they are.
